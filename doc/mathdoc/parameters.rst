.. module:: MvsoModel

Parameters
==========
All the parameters that the optimization model requires to calculate an optimal solution will be listed and defined in this section.
A parameter is a data, that is provided by the user before the optimization simulation starts. These parameters are the values that define the specifications of the modeled energy system. Parameters of this optimization model can be seperated into two main parts, these are Technical and Economical Parameters.
