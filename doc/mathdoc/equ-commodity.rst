Commodity Constraints
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Commodity Balance** The function commodity balance calculates the balance of a commodity :math:`c` in a site :math:`v` at a timestep :math:`t`. Commodity balance function facilitates the formulation of commodity constraints. The formula for commodity balance is expressed in mathematical notation as:

.. math::

	\mathrm{CB}(v,c,t) = 
          \sum_{p|c \in C_{vp}^\text{in}} \epsilon_{vcpt}^\text{in}
        - \sum_{p|c \in C_{vp}^\text{out}} \epsilon_{vcpt}^\text{out}
        + \sum_{{s\in S_{vc}}} \left( \epsilon_{vst}^\text{in} - \epsilon_{vst}^\text{out} \right)
        + \sum_{{\substack{a\in A_v^\text{s}\\ f \in F_{vc}^\text{exp}}}} \pi_{aft}^\text{in}
        - \sum_{{\substack{a\in A_v^\text{p}\\ f \in F_{vc}^\text{imp}}}} \pi_{aft}^\text{out}

This function sums up for a given commodity :math:`c`, site :math:`v` and timestep :math:`t`;

* the consumption: Process input commodity flow :math:`\epsilon_{vcpt}^\text{in}` of all process tuples using the commodity :math:`c` in the site :math:`v` at the timestep :math:`t`.
* the export: Input transmission power flow :math:`\pi_{aft}^\text{in}` of all transmission tuples exporting the commodity :math:`c` from the origin site :math:`v` at the timestep :math:`t`.
* the storage input: Input power flow :math:`\epsilon_{vst}^\text{in}` of all storage tuples storing the commodity :math:`c` in the site :math:`v` at the timestep :math:`t`.

and subtracts for the same given commodity :math:`c`, site :math:`v` and timestep :math:`t`;

* the creation: Process output commodity flow :math:`\epsilon_{vcpt}^\text{out}` of all process tuples using the commodity :math:`c` in the site :math:`v` at the timestep :math:`t`.
* the import: Output transmission power flow :math:`\pi_{aft}^\text{out}` of all transmission tuples importing the commodity math:`c` to the destination site :math:`v` at the timestep :math:`t`.
* the storage output: Output power flow :math:`\epsilon_{vst}^\text{out}` of all storage tuples storing the commodity :math:`c` in the site :math:`v` at the timestep :math:`t`.

The value of the function :math:`\mathrm{CB}` being greater than zero :math:`\mathrm{CB} > 0` means that the presence of the commodity :math:`c` in the site :math:`v` at the timestep :math:`t` is getting less than before by the technologies given above. Correspondingly, the value of the function being less than zero means that the presence of the commodity in the site at the timestep is getting more than before by the technologies given above.

In script ``model.py`` the value of the commodity balance function :math:`\mathrm{CB}(v,c,t)` is calculated by the following code fragment: 

.. literalinclude:: /../MvsoModel/modelhelper.py
   :pyobject: commodity_balance



**Vertex Rule**: Vertex rule is the main constraint that has to be satisfied for every commodity. This constraint is defined differently for each commodity type. The inequality requires, that any imbalance (CB>0, CB<0) of a commodity :math:`c` in a site :math:`v` at a timestep :math:`t` to be balanced by a corresponding source term or demand.

* Environmental commodities :math:`C_\text{env}`: this constraint is not defined for environmental commodities.
* Suppy intermittent commodities :math:`C_\text{sup}`: this constraint is not defined for supply intermittent commodities.
* Stock commodities :math:`C_\text{st}`: For stock commodities, the possible imbalance of the commodity must be supplied by the stock commodity purchases. In other words, commodity balance :math:`\mathrm{CB}(v,c,t)` subtracted from the variable stock commodity source term :math:`\rho_{vct}` must be greater than or equal to 0 to satisfy this constraint. In mathematical notation this is expressed as:

.. math::
	\forall v\in V, c\in C_\text{st}, t\in T_m\colon\ - \mathrm{CB}(v,c,t) + \rho_{vct} \geq 0


* Sell commodities :math:`C_\text{sell}`: For sell commodities, the possible imbalance of the commodity must be supplied by the sell commodity trades. In other words, commodity balance :math:`\mathrm{CB}(v,c,t)` subtracted from minus the variable sell commodity source term :math:`\varrho_{vct}` must be greater than or equal to 0 to satisfy this constraint. In mathematical notation this is expressed as:

.. math::
	\forall v\in V, c\in C_\text{sell}, t\in T_m\colon\ - \mathrm{CB}(v,c,t) - \varrho_{vct} \geq 0

* Buy commodities :math:`C_\text{buy}`: For buy commodities, the possible imbalance of the commodity must be supplied by the buy commodity purchases. In other words, commodity balance :math:`\mathrm{CB}(v,c,t)` subtracted from the variable buy commodity source term :math:`\psi_{vct}` must be greater than or equal to 0 to satisfy this constraint. In mathematical notation this is expressed as:

.. math::
	\forall v\in V, c\in C_\text{buy}, t\in T_m\colon\ - \mathrm{CB}(v,c,t) + \psi_{vct} \geq 0

* Demand commodities :math:`C_\text{dem}`: For demand commodities, the possible imbalance of the commodity must supply the demand :math:`d_{vct}` of demand commodities :math:`c \in C_\text{dem}`. In other words, the parameter demand for commodity subtracted :math:`d_{vct}` from the minus commodity balance :math:`-\mathrm{CB}(v,c,t)` must be greater than or equal to 0 to satisfy this constraint. In mathematical notation this is expressed as: 

.. math::
	\forall v\in V, c\in C_\text{dem}, t\in T_m\colon\ - \mathrm{CB}(v,c,t) - d_{vct} \geq 0
    
* Demand Side Management commodities and sites: For any combination of commodity and site for which demand side management is defined, the upshift is substracted and the downshift added to the negative commodity balance :math:`-\mathrm{CB}(v,c,t)`.

.. math::
	\forall (v,c) in D_{vc}, t\in T_m\colon\ - \mathrm{CB}(v,c,t) - \delta_{vct}^\text{up}` + \sum_{tt \in D_{vct,tt}^\text{down}} \delta_{vct,tt}^\text{down}` \geq 0

In script ``model.py`` the constraint vertex rule is defined and calculated by the following code fragments:

::

		m.res_vertex = pyomo.Constraint(
			m.tm, m.com_tuples,

Demand Side Management Constraints
----------------------------------

The DSM equations are taken from the Paper of Zerrahn and Schill "On the representation of demand-side management in power system models", DOI: `10.1016/j.energy.2015.03.037 <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2015.03.037>`_.

**DSM Variables Rule**: The DSM variables rule defines the relation between upshift and downshift. An upshift :math:`\delta_{vct}^\text{up}` in site :math:`v` of commodity :math:`c` in time step :math:`t` can be compensated during a certain time interval :math:`[t-y_{vc}, t+y_{vc}]` by multiple downshifts :math:`\delta_{vct,tt}^\text{down}`. Depending on the efficiency :math:`e_{vc}`, less downshifts have to be made. This is given by:

.. math::
    \forall (v,c) \in D_{vc}, t\in T\colon\  \delta_{vct}^\text{up} e_{vc} = \sum_{tt = t-y_{vc}}^{t+y_{vc}} \delta_{vct,tt}^\text{down}

.. literalinclude:: /../MvsoModel/model.py
   :pyobject: res_dsm_downward_rule
        

**DSM Maximum Rule**: The DSM maximum rule limits the shift of one DSM unit in site :math:`v` of commodity :math:`c` in time step :math:`t`. In mathematical terms, this is written as:

.. math::
    \forall (v,c) \in D_{vc}, tt\in T \colon\  \delta_{vct}^\text{up} + \sum_{t = tt-y}^{tt+y} \delta_{vct,tt}^\text{down} \leq \max \left\lbrace \overline{K}_{vc}^\text{up}, \overline{K}_{vc}^\text{down} \right\rbrace

Global Environmental Constraint
-------------------------------

**Global CO2 Limit Rule**: The constraint global CO2 limit rule applies to the whole energy system, that is to say it applies to every site and timestep in general. This constraints restricts the energy model from releasing more environmental commodities, namely CO2 to environment than allowed. The constraint states that the sum of released environmental commodities for every site :math:`v` and every timestep :math:`t` must be less than or equal to the parameter maximum global annual CO2 emission limit :math:`\overline{L}_{CO_{2}}`, where the amount of released enviromental commodites in a single site :math:`v` at a single timestep :math:`t` is calculated by the product of commodity balance of enviromental commodities :math:`\mathrm{CB}(v,CO_{2},t)` and the parameter weight :math:`w`. This constraint is skipped if the value of the parameter :math:`\overline{L}_{CO_{2}}` is set to ``inf``. In mathematical notation this constraint is expressed as:

.. math::

	w \sum_{t\in T_\text{m}} \sum_{v \in V} \mathrm{-CB}(v,CO_{2},t) \leq \overline{L}_{CO_{2}}
