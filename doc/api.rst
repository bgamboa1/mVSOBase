.. module:: MvsoModel

MvsoModel.py module description
--------------------------

Overview
^^^^^^^^

The following is a minimum "hello world" script that shows the life cycle of 
the optimization object `prob`, and how the various :mod:`MvsoModel` module 
functions create it, modify it and process it.::

    import MvsoModel
    from pyomo.opt.base import SolverFactory
    
    # read input, create optimisation problem
    data = MvsoModel.read_excel('mimo-example.xlsx')
    prob = MvsoModel.create_model(data)

    # solve problem, read results
    optim = SolverFactory('glpk')
    result = optim.solve(prob)
    prob.solutions.load_from(result)
    
    # save problem instance (incl. input and result) for later analyses
    MvsoModel.save(prob, 'mimo-example.pgz')

    # write report and plot timeseries
    MvsoModel.report(prob, 'report.xlsx')
    MvsoModel.plot(prob, 'Elec', 'Mid')

The following lists and describes the use of all module-level functions. They
are roughly ordered from high-level to low-level access, followed by helper 
functions.

Create model
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. function:: read_excel(filename)

  :param str filename: spreadsheet filename
  :return: MvsoModel input dict 
  
  The spreadsheet must contain 7 sheets labelled 'Commodity', 'Process',
  'Process-Commodity', 'Transmission', 'Storage', 'Demand' and 'SupIm'.
  It can contain 2 additional sheets called 'Buy-Sell-Price' and 'Hacks'.
  If present, function :func:`add_hacks` is called by :func:`create_model`
  upon model creation.
  
  Refer to the `mimo-example.xlsx` file for exemplary documentation of the 
  table contents and definitions of all attributes by selecting the column
  titles. 
  
  
.. function:: create_model(data, timesteps)

  Returns a Pyomo `ConcreteModel` object.
  
  :param dict data: input like created by :func:`read_excel`
  :param list timesteps: consecutive list of modelled timesteps
  
  :return: MvsoModel model object
  
  Timestep numbers must match those of the demand and supim timeseries.
  
  If argument ``data`` has the key ``'hacks'``, function :func:`add_hacks` is
  called with ``data['hacks']`` as the second argument.  

  
.. function:: add_hacks(model, hacks)

    Is called by :func:`create_model` to add special elements, e.g.
    constraints, to the model. Each hack, if present, can trigger the creation
    of additional sets, parameters, variables or constraints. Refer to the 
    `code`__ of this function to see which hacks exists and what they do.
    
.. __: https://github.com/tum-ens/MvsoModel/blob/master/MvsoModel.py#L798-L824
    
    As of v0.3, only one hack exists: if a line "Global CO2 limit" exists in
    the hacks DataFrame, its value is used as a global upper limit for a
    constraint that limits the annual creation of the commodity "CO2".
    
    :param model: MvsoModel model object (not instance!)
    :param hacks: a DataFrame of hacks  
    
    :return model: the modified MvsoModel model object

  
Report & plotting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These two **high-level** functions cover the envisioned use of the unmodified
MvsoModel model and should cover most use cases.

.. function:: plot(prob, com, sit, [timesteps=None])

    :param prob: MvsoModel model instance
    :param str com: commodity name to plot
    :param str sit: site name to plot
    :param list timesteps: timesteps to plot, default: all
    
    :return fig: matplotlib figure handle 

  
.. function:: report(prob, filename, commodities, sites)

    Write optimisation result summary to spreadsheet.
    
    :param prob: MvsoModel model instance
    :param str filename: spreadsheet filename, will be overwritten if exists
    :param list commodities: list of commodities for which to output timeseries
    :param list sites: list sites for which to output timeseries


.. _medium-level-functions:
  
Retrieve results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While :func:`report` and :func:`plot` are quite flexible, custom
result analysis scripts might be needed. These can be built on top of the
following two **medium-level** functions. They retrieve all time-dependent and
-independent quantities and return them as ready-to-use DataFrames.

.. function:: get_constants(prob)
  
  Return summary DataFrames for time-independent variables
  
  :param prob: MvsoModel model instance
  
  :return: tuple of constants (costs, process, transmission, storage)

  
.. function:: get_timeseries(prob, com, sit, timesteps=None)

  Return DataFrames of all timeseries referring to a given commodity and site

  :param prob: MvsoModel model instance
  :param str com: commodity name
  :param str sit: site name
  :param list timesteps: timesteps, default: all modelled timesteps

  :return: tuple of timeseries (created, consumed, storage, imported, exported) 
    tuple of DataFrames timeseries. These are:

        * created: timeseries of commodity creation, including stock source
        * consumed: timeseries of commodity consumption, including demand
        * storage: timeseries of commodity storage (level, stored, retrieved)
        * imported: timeseries of commodity import (by site)
        * exported: timeseries of commodity export (by site)

        
Persistence
^^^^^^^^^^^

To store valuable results for later analysis, or cross-scenario comparisons
weeks after the original run, saving a problem instance with loaded results
makes it possible to use one's comparison scripts without having to solve the
optimisation problem again. Simply :func:`load` the previously stored object 
using :func:`save`:

.. function:: save(prob, filename)

    Save rivus model instance to a gzip'ed pickle file
    
    `Pickle <https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html>`_ is the standard
    Python way of serializing and de-serializing Python objects. By using it,
    saving any object, in case of this function a Pyomo ConcreteModel, becomes
    a twoliner.
    
    `GZip <https://docs.python.org/2/library/gzip.html>`_ is a standard Python
    compression library that is used to transparently compress the pickle file
    further.
    
    It is used over the possibly more compact bzip2 compression due to the
    lower runtime. Source: <http://stackoverflow.com/a/18475192/2375855>
    
    :param prob: a rivus model instance
    :param str filename: pickle file to be written
        
    :return: nothing
        
.. function:: load(filename)

    Load a rivus model instance from a gzip'ed pickle file
    
    :param str filename: pickle file
    
    :return prob: the unpickled rivus model instance

Low-level access
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the previous functions still don't cut it, there are three **low-level**
functions.

.. function:: list_entities(prob, entity_type)

  :param prob: MvsoModel model instance
  :param str entity_type: allowed values: set, par, var, con, obj 
  
  :return: a DataFrame with name, description and domain of entities

.. function:: get_entity(prob, name)

  :param prob: MvsoModel model instance
  :param str name: name of a model entity

  :return: Series with values of model entity
  
.. function:: get_entities(prob, names)

  :param prob: MvsoModel model instance
  :param list name: list of model entity names
  
  :return: DataFrame with values entities in columns
  
  Only call ``get_entities`` for entities that share identical
  domains. This can be checked with :func:`list_entities`. For example,
  variable ``cap_pro`` naturally has the same domain as ``cap_pro_new``.
  
Helper functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. function:: annuity_factor(n, i)

  Annuity factor formula.

  Evaluates the annuity factor formula for depreciation duration
  and interest rate. Works also well for equally sized numpy arrays as input.
    
  :param int n: number of depreciation periods (years)
  :param float i: interest rate (e.g. 0.06 means 6 %)

  :return: value of the expression :math:`\frac{(1+i)^n i}{(1+i)^n - 1}`

  
.. function:: commodity_balance(m, tm, sit, com)

  Calculate commodity balance at given timestep.

  For a given commodity, site and timestep, calculate the balance of
  consumed (to process/storage/transmission, counts positive) and provided
  (from process/storage/transmission, counts negative) energy. Used as helper
  function in :func:`create_model` for defining constraints on demand and 
  stock commodities.

  :param m: the ConcreteModel object
  :param tm: the timestep number
  :param sit: the site
  :param co: the commodity

  :return: amount of consumed (positive) or provided (negative) energy

  
.. function:: split_columns(columns, [sep='.'])

  Given a list of column labels containing a separator string (default: '.'),
  derive a MulitIndex that is split at the separator string.
  
  :param list columns: column labels, each containing the separator string
  :param str sep: the separator string (default: '.')
  
  :return: a MultiIndex corresponding to input, with levels split at separator
  
  
.. function:: to_color(obj=None)

  Assign a deterministic pseudo-random color to argument.

  If :data:`COLORS[obj] <COLORS>` is set, return that. Otherwise, create a
  deterministically random color from the :func:`hash` of that object. For
  strings, this value depends only on the string content, so that identical
  strings always yield the same color.

  :param obj: any hashable object

  :return: a `(r,g,b)` tuple if COLORS[obj] exists, otherwise a hexstring

.. data:: COLORS
  
  :class:`dict` of process and site colors. Colors are stored as `(r,g,b)`
  tuples in range `0-255` each. To retrieve a color in a form usable with 
  matplotlib, used the helper function :func:`to_color`.
  
  This snippet from the  example script `runme.py` shows how to add custom 
  colors::
      
      # add or change plot colours
      my_colors = {
          'South': (230, 200, 200),
          'Mid': (200, 230, 200),
          'North': (200, 200, 230)}
      for country, color in my_colors.items():
          MvsoModel.COLORS[country] = color
